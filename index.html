        <p>Solve all the algorithms below using the T-Diagram, as outlined in class. Remember the lego principle: a solution that works is better than a solution you copied from a classmate or from the internet. Have fun with it!</p>
        <ol>
            <li> Print 1 - 135</li>
            <p>Write a program using JavaScript that will print all the numbers from 1 to 135.</p>
            <li>Print Odd Numbers 1 - 135</li>
            <p>Write a program using JavaScript that will print all the odd numbers from 1 to 135.</p>
            <li>Sum of Printed Numbers</li>
            <p>Write a program that will print all the numbers from 1 to 135 AND the sum of the numbers that have been printed so far. Your output should look similar to this:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Number is: 0 Sum: 0</li>
                <li>Number is: 1 Sum: 1</li>
                <li>Number is: 2 Sum: 3</li>
                <li>Number is: 3 Sum: 6</li>
                <li>....</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You are NOT allowed to use an array to solve this exercise.</p>
            <li>Print the elements of an array</li>
            <p>Given an array X = [1,4,2,12], write a program that will iterate through the array and print all numbers on the screen. Your program should work with arrays of all sizes.</p>
            <li>Find Max</li>
            <p>Given an array X, write a program that would find the maximum value of the array. Your program should work also work with negative values (eg. X = [2,-3,-1]) and zero.</p>
            <li>Get Average</li>
            <p>Given an array X, write a program that will return the average value of all elements in the array. For example, for array X = [2,1,3] your output should be 2.</p>
            <li>Eliminate the Negatives</li>
            <p>Given an array X, write a program that will remove all negative numbers and replace them with a 0. For example, for array X = [2,-1,4,-3] the output of your program should be [2,0,4,0].</p>
            <li>Number to String</li>
            <p>Write a program that takes an array of numbers and turns the negative values to strings. For example, for array X = [1,-4,0,-1] the output should be [1,'Turing,0,'Turing'].</p>
